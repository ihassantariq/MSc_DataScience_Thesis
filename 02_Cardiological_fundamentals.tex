\cite{ecg1} "An electrocardiogram (ECG) is a measure of how the electrical activity of the heart changes over time, as action potentials within each myocyte propagate throughout the heart as a whole during each cardiac cycle. In other words, the ECG is the recording of the cumulative signals produced by populations of cells eliciting changes in their membrane potentials at a given point in time. The ECG provides specific waveforms of electrical differences when the atria and ventricles depolarize and repolarize."

\section{The human heart nature} \label{heart_nature}

For the purposes of an ECG, the human body can be thought of as a large volume conductor. It is made up of tissues and a conductive media in which the heart is suspended. The heart contracts during the cardiac cycle in response to coordinated action potentials traveling through the chambers of the heart. One section of the heart tissue is depolarized, while another is at rest or polarized, as is usual. 

The intensity of the voltages observed is determined by the electrodes' orientation in relation to the dipole ends. The signal amplitudes are proportional to the mass of tissue used to create the dipole at any particular time. Electrodes are typically placed on the skin's surface to detect the voltages of these electrical fields, giving rise to the ECG \cite{ecg1}.

\begin{figure}[H]

\caption{After conduction begins at the sinoatrial node, cells in the atria begin to depolarize. This creates an electrical wavefront that moves down toward the ventricles, with polarized cells at the front. The separation of charge results in a dipole across the heart (the large black arrow shows its direction) \cite{ecg1}.}

\section{ECG's history} \label{ecg_history}

The discovery of intrinsic electrical activity within the heart dates all the way back to the 1840s. Carlo Matteucci, an Italian physicist, was the first to discover that each heartbeat is accompanied by an electrical current in 1842. Emil DuBois-Reymond, a German scientist, published the first action potential associated with muscular contraction not long after. In 1856, Rudolph von Koelliker and Heinrich Miller used a galvanometer to record the first cardiac action potential. Following that, Augustus D. Waller recorded the first human ECG after Gabriel Lippmann invented the capillary electrometer in the early 1870s. That first device is shown in Figure \ref{fig:Kapillarelektrometer}.

\begin{figure}[H]

\end{figure}

Willem Einthoven's creation of the string galvanometer in 1901 was a key milestone in cardiac electrocardiography. The next year, he published the first ECG using his string galvanometer. Einthoven's string galvanometer consisted of a huge electromagnet with a thin silver-coated string stretched across it; electric currents passing through the thread caused the string to move from side to side in the electromagnet's magnetic field.


Einthoven made yet another significant addition to cardiac electrophysiology in 1912, when he discovered a mathematical link between the direction and size of the deflections recorded by the three limb leads. Einthoven's triangle is the name for this hypothesis. Before Frank Wilson described unipolar leads and the precordial lead configuration, the typical three-limb leads were used for three decades. The traditional Einthoven limb leads, as well as the precordial and unipolar limb leads based on Wilson's work, make up the 12-lead ECG layout now in use.


This instrument was initially manufactured in 1905 by the Cambridge Scientific Instrument Company in London. Electrical impulses were sent from a hospital over a mile away to Einthoven's laboratory via a telephone cable. Bedside machines, on the other hand, were not available until the 1920s. The Sanborn Company produced a smaller version of the unit in 1935 that weighed only about 25 pounds.

\begin{figure}[H]

\includegraphics[scale=0.7]{img/holter_edan_ecg.PNG}
\caption{Holter-Edan ECG device}
\label{fig:holter_monitor}
\end{figure}

With Norman Jeff Holter's invention of the Holter monitor in 1949, the use of ECG in a nonclinical context became viable. The first iteration of this device was a 75-pound backpack that could record the ECG continually and send the signals via radio. The size of subsequent iterations of such devices has been drastically decreased, and the signal is now recorded digitally. Miniaturized devices now allow patients to be monitored for longer periods of time (typically 24 hours) to aid in the diagnosis of any rhythm or ischemic heart disease concerns. One of the latest versions of the ECG is the one appearing in Figure \ref{fig:holter_monitor}.

\section{The ECG Waveform} \label{ecg_waveform}

Signals of voltage versus time are created during the recording of an ECG, which are generally shown in millivolts (mV) vs seconds. Figure \ref{fig:ECG_waveform} depicts a typical Lead II ECG waveform. The negative electrode was placed on the right wrist and the positive electrode on the left ankle for this Lead II ECG recording. As a result, a series of peaks and waves can be seen, each of which corresponds to ventricular or atrial depolarization and repolarization, with each segment of the signal indicating a separate event in the cardiac cycle.

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.7]{img/ECG_waveform.PNG}
\caption{A typical ECG waveform for one cardiac cycle, measured from the Lead II position \cite{ecg1}.}
\label{fig:ECG_waveform}
\end{figure}
 
Three principal waveforms are recorded by the ECG (\ref{fig:ECG_waveform}):

\begin{itemize}
    \item The P-wave
    \item QRS complex
    \item T-wave.
\end{itemize}

The P-wave is created by depolarisation of the atria, the QRS by depolarisation of the ventricles, and the T-wave by repolarisation of the ventricles. In most people, these waveforms occur in a repeating rhythm called sinus rhythm, so called because it originates in the sinus node. In some people, a fourth waveform (not shown in the previous image) called a U-wave can be seen. This is usually seen at slower heart rates. The significance of the U-wave remains uncertain. Some authors think that it represents the late stages of ventricular repolarisation, while others describe it as a post-repolarisation phenomenon. U-wave abnormalities have been described in various disease states including ischaemic heart disease \cite{ecg2}.
 
 The depolarization of the sinoatrial node, which is positioned within the right atrium, starts the typical cardiac cycle. A conventional ECG will not detect this early firing because the node does not have enough cells to provide a measurable electrical potential. The right and left ventricles continue to depolarize after the P wave, resulting in the recordable QRS complex, which lasts about 100 milliseconds. The Q-wave is the initial negative deflection (if present), the R-wave is the largest positive deflection, and the S-wave is the smallest positive deflection \cite{ecg3}.
 
 
 The T-wave is usually the last potential in a cardiac cycle, followed by the P-wave of the next cycle, and so on. The ECG signal returns to baseline near the conclusion of ventricular contraction, and the ventricles repolarize after contraction. Atrial contractions have stopped and the atria are repolarizing at the same time as the QRS complex. Because the effects of this widespread atrial repolarization are obscured by the much larger volume of tissue engaged in ventricular depolarization, it is not generally detectable in an ECG \cite{ecg1}. 
 
 
\section{The 12-leads ECG} \label{12_lead_ecg}

An ECG lead is a recording of the heart's electrical activity as seen from one side. As a result, when we take a 12-lead ECG, we're recording cardiac electrical activity from 12 different angles \cite{ecg3}. Assume you're visiting a historic structure and taking images of it. If you snap 12 photos from different angles around the structure, each one will depict a distinct element, such as the front, sides, and back. They work together to provide a three-dimensional record of the structure's shape and appearance. In a similar way, a 12-lead ECG creates a three-dimensional depiction of the heart's electrical activity.

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.24]{img/normal_ecg.png}
\caption{12-leads normal ECG}
\label{fig:normal_ecg}
\end{figure}

Multiple images of the heart's electrical activity can be recorded depending on the type of machine utilized and the number of electrodes inserted. The usage of 12-lead ECG devices is common among health-care professionals. Twelve separate electrical images of the heart are measured and recorded via a 12-lead ECG (Figure \ref{fig:normal_ecg}). In other words, it records the electrical activity of the heart as observed from 12 various angles. For example, Lead II monitors electrical activity as observed from the heart's inferior (diaphragmatic) surface. This lead is frequently used to measure heart rate \cite{basic_arryth}.

\section{Arrhythmias Types} \label{arrhythmias_types}

Analyzing arrhythmias is a difficult undertaking since every person on the planet has a unique ECG that differs from everyone else's, and one person's ECG can change dramatically from one second to the next. Memorizing some of the most common ECG patterns and attempting to recognize them in the future is insufficient. Pattern identification is a popular yet unintentional way of approaching arrhythmias via ECG analysis (\cite{arryth_types}). Often the Arrhythmias are divided into two global categories:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Rhythmic}: Determined as a sequence of uneven beats
    \item \textbf{Morphological}: Made of abnormal single beat
\end{enumerate}

The work presented in the current thesis is focused on first type of classification. Those arrhythmias have a categorization provided by SNOMED CT. The latter is the world's most complete and precise terminology package, with widespread acceptance around the world. It provides a common language for clinical IT systems, making data exchange between them easier, safer, and more accurate. It covers everything from processes and symptoms to clinical measurements, diagnosis, and drugs, and it's all in one place.

For the Physionet 2020 challenge were only considered around 27 arrhythmias, which are the most frequently found regarding the ECG analysis. Nevertheless, along the following paragraphs there is a deep explanation of all the possible arrhythmias. To see the complete list of categories it is possible to read the GitHub cited in \cite{github_arrhythmias}.

Arrhythmias are often divided into groups based on where the rhythm is initiated by the pacemaker. The following are the most prevalent sites, and consequently the primary arrhythmia categories:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Sinus
    \item Atrial
    \item Junctional
    \item Ventricular
    \item AV Blocks
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Sinus}

It is necessary to comprehend the 'benchmark' rhythm, or hemodynamically perfect rhythm, which is referred to as \textbf{Normal Sinus Rhythm} and sometimes abbreviated to \textbf{NSR}, in order to assess cardiac rhythms (Figure \ref{fig:nsr}). The following features must be present in order for a rhythm to be classified as Normal Sinus Rhythm:

\textbf{Sinus Bradycardia (SB)}: When a patient's heart rate falls below 60 beats per minute, they are said to be bradycardic. Slow heart rates can be seen in fit and active people who are usually asymptomatic. When a patient's heart rate falls below 60 beats per minute, critical care nurses must be ready to assess for decreasing cardiac output right away.

\textbf{Sinus Tachycardia (STach)}: When a patient's heart rate exceeds 100 beats per minute, they are labeled tachycardic, though most people don't notice symptoms until their heart rate exceeds 150 beats per minute. At this point, a critical care nurse should look for signs and symptoms of decreased cardiac output (such as hypotension or a loss of consciousness).

\subsection{AV Blocks}

Electrical conduction failure via the myocardium is characterized by atrioventricular (AV) blockages. Because AV blockages are linked to severe risk worsening or haemodynamic impairment, the critical care nurse must recognize and treat them as soon as possible. 1st degree heart block, 2nd degree heart block (Mobitz type 1 or Wenkebach), and 3rd degree heart block are all types of AV block (complete heart block).  (\cite{arryth_types})

\textbf{First Degree AV Block (IAVB)}: It is caused by AV nodal disease, Enhanced vagal tone (i.e. athletes), Myocarditis, Following Myocardial Infarction, Electrolyte disturbances, Medications (i.e. Calcium channel blockers, Beta blockers).

\textbf{Second Degree Type I (IIAVB)}: It is caused by Ischemia. Usually benign, with no treatment required. If patient becomes haemodynamically compromised interventions for bradycardia should be considered.
